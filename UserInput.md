# Introduction #

The controls are designed so that the game is playable without any device other than a regular keyboard.

Thus, a mouse is not directly needed to play the game, and consequently the game doesn't support it. Some time in the future, a mouse might be supported and used on menus as a way of clicking or focusing on an item.

This articles describes the controls the default controls the player has in the game.

# In-game controls #

## Selecting a character ##

Up to five characters can be displayed and control in the game. Only one character is controlled at a time.

The following numeric keys can be used to select a character (i.e. making it the one the user controls).
Note that these keys are not these on the numeric keypad by default.

  * **1** to select "the [hero](CharacterHero.md)" ;
  * **2** to select [water](CharacterWater.md) ;
  * **3** to select [earth](CharacterEarth.md) ;
  * **4** to select [air](CharacterAir.md) ;
  * **5** to select [fire](CharacterFire.md).

Also note that the order of the keys matches both the order of the character icons in the [in-game interface](UserInterfaceIngame.md) and the order of apparition of the characters in the game's story.

## Moving a character ##

Once a character is controlled by the player, the latter is able to move the former.

This is performed through classic controls:

  * **Up (or W or Z)** makes the character jump or go up, depending on its context (in water...) ;
  * **Left (or Q or A)** makes the character go to left ;
  * **Down (or S)** makes the character go down or not, depending on its context ;
  * **Right (or D)** makes the character go to right.

## Activating a character's power ##

A player-controlled character is able to perform a "power".

The power is enabled or launched or triggered by pressing the **Space** key.


## Merging two characters ##

Two characters can be merged together in order to create another one with special abilities.

Once a character is controlled, and is brought "close enough" to another one, merging occurs when the player presses **R** or **Enter**.

The resulting merged character is selectable by selecting one of its two underlying constituting characters.

For instance, if one merges fire and water to produce the "Steam" character, then this character can be selected by pressing either **2** (for selecting Water) or **5** (for selecting Fire).

The merged character can be un-merged in order to give back to the player the two underlying characters. While controlling the merged character, this is performed by pressing **R** or **Enter** again.

Once a character is un-merged, the latest selected underlying character will be selected.
For instance, if one selected Steam by pressing **2** (for selecting Water), and then un-merges Steam, then Water will be the selected character.
