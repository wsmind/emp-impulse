In order to develop on the Impulse project, you will have to read through the following documents:
  * [Getting started](DevStart.md) - Tool installation and setup
  * [Wiki](DevMeta.md) - Overview of the wiki organization and central features
  * [Component life cyle](DevComponent.md) - Requirements, design, etc.
  * [Workflow](DevWorkflow.md) - How people interact with the numerous Hg repositories
  * [Build system](DevBuild.md) - How to use the EMP additions to scons
  * [Test framework](DevTests.md) - Where and how to write tests

We will also make use of most of the [coding guidelines](http://code.google.com/p/potatoengine/wiki/DevCodeStyle) of the Potato Engine.
