# Introduction #

There will be two sets of menus:

  * The **main menu** (outside the game) allows different things like to:
    * start a new game ;
    * continue the current game ;
    * set up options ;
    * exit...

  * The **in-game menu** allows to:
    1. restart the level ;
    1. go back to the main menu. A sub menu asks if the player really wants to discard is current game and go back to the menu.

All of this is done with text and static images in pure Braid fashion. The text color changes when the mouse hovers it.
