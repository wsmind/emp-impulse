# Boundaries #

The player is prevented by going left. Although no specific decor element (like cliffs) is specified, the screen just won't scroll if the player attempts to go left.

The player is prevented to go right as well, but this boundary will only be encountered by the player if she jumps over the glowing ball (which is the level's end point).
